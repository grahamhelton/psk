# psk
PSK is a simple tool for easily killing multiple processes at once. This is accomplished by searching through linux processes for a keyword and allowing the user to select multiple processes from a list to kill. Special thanks to [charm](https://charm.sh/) for their utility gum which makes this possible.

# Usage
`psk [process to search for]`
